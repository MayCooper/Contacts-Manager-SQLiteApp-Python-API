# Contacts-Manager-SQLiteApp-Python-API
# PyContacts: A Pythonic Contacts Manager with SQLite and API Integration with APIs
### Utilizing SQlite database, SQlite studio, read-write functionality to delete/edit/update contacts with Python, and more. 

This is a project for managing contacts using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Tkinter library in Python. The project provides a contact management system with features such as adding new contacts, viewing existing contacts, deleting selected contacts, and modifying selected contacts. 

The contacts are stored in an SQLite database (contacts.db) and the GUI allows users to interact with the data through a tree view widget. 

Additionally, the project includes an API for interacting with the contact data programmatically, providing external access to the contact management functionality.

Some examples from the project:
